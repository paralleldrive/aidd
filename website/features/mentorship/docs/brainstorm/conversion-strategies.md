## AIDD Mentorship Program

### Conversion Psychology Principles

#### 1. Scarcity and Urgency
**Implementation for AIDD Mentorship:**
- "Only 5 mentorship slots available this quarter"

- Exclusive access appeal

#### 2. Authority and Credibility
**Eric Elliott's Authority Markers:**

**Credibility Boosters:**
- Specific, measurable outcomes from past mentees

#### 3. Social Proof Hierarchy
**Most Powerful to Least:**
1. **Peer testimonials** - Other developers like the visitor

4. **Expert endorsements** - Industry leader recommendations
5. **Media mentions** - Press or blog coverage
