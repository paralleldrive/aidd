# README Update Epic

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (2025-10-20)  
**Goal**: Make README production-ready

## Overview

We're updating the README to make it production-ready by fixing critical gaps that prevent user adoption: commands appear without context, duplicate emoji sections confuse navigation, no security information blocks enterprise adoption, and missing troubleshooting leaves users stuck. These fixes transform the README from "good" to "production-ready."
