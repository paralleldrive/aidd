# Story Mapper UI Prototype Epic

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Goal**: Create a GenAI-first user story mapping tool with Avion-like UX and cyberglassmorphism dark mode design

## Overview

Product teams need a visual way to organize user journeys, steps, and stories that integrates naturally with GenAI workflows, addressing the gap between traditional story mapping tools (like Avion) and modern AI-assisted product development where stories can be generated, refined, and evolved through conversational interfaces while maintaining the proven three-tier hierarchy that keeps teams aligned on user value.

## Create UI Prototype Foundation

Build the base HTML/CSS structure for the story mapper canvas with dark mode cyberglassmorphism styling.

**Requirements**:
- Given a product team needs to visualize user journeys, should render three-tier hierarchy (journeys â†’ steps â†’ stories)
- Given users expect modern aesthetics, should apply frosted glass effects with backdrop-filter blur and RGBA transparency
- Given dark mode reduces eye strain, should use deep blue/purple backgrounds with high-contrast text
- Given the canvas may contain many cards, should optimize rendering with CSS containment

---

## Implement Journey Row Layout

Create the top-level journey row structure with horizontal scrolling.

**Requirements**:
- Given journeys are long-lived and rarely change, should display as prominent row headers spanning horizontally
- Given multiple journeys may exist, should enable smooth horizontal scrolling with clear visual boundaries
- Given users need to add journeys, should show add journey affordance at row end

---

## Build Step Column Structure

Design the step columns beneath each journey with proper vertical alignment.

**Requirements**:
- Given each journey has sequential steps, should render steps as columns beneath their parent journey
- Given steps represent user actions in sequence, should maintain clear left-to-right flow with consistent spacing
- Given users may add steps, should provide inline add step capability within each journey

---

## Design Story Card Layout

Create the user story cards that stack beneath each step.

**Requirements**:
- Given multiple stories contribute to a single step, should stack story cards vertically beneath their parent step
- Given stories change over time, should use visual indicators (borders, icons) to show story status or maturity
- Given glassmorphism can reduce readability, should ensure story card text has high contrast (white/cyan on glass)
- Given users scan many stories quickly, should display story title, description snippet, and key metadata in compact format

---

## Add GenAI Integration Indicators

Include visual elements showing where AI assistance is available.

**Requirements**:
- Given this is a GenAI-first tool, should indicate which stories were AI-generated with subtle badges or icons
- Given users may want AI help, should show hover states or sparkle effects on cards suggesting AI refinement is available
- Given natural language is the interface, should include placeholder for AI chat panel integration point

---

## Create Responsive Grid System

Build the grid layout that maintains hierarchy at different viewport sizes.

**Requirements**:
- Given large canvases need navigation, should implement zoom and pan capabilities with mini-map indicator
- Given teams collaborate remotely, should ensure layout remains comprehensible on laptop screens (1440px+)
- Given the three-tier structure is essential, should preserve visual hierarchy even when zoomed out

---

## Apply Cyber Aesthetic Touches

Add the distinctive cyberglassmorphism visual flourishes.

**Requirements**:
- Given cyber aesthetics use neon accents, should incorporate electric blue, cyan, and magenta highlights on interactive elements
- Given glassmorphism depth comes from layering, should use subtle gradients and glow effects on card borders
- Given consistency matters, should define CSS custom properties for reusable glass surface styles (blur radius, opacity, border highlight)
