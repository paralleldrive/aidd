# aidd churn Epic

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (core complete, bug fixes remaining)  
**Goal**: Add `npx aidd churn` — a CLI command that ranks files by composite hotspot score to identify prime PR split candidates

## Overview

PRs are hard to scope without knowing where complexity actually lives. Developers need a fast, reproducible way to identify which files are the highest-risk to change — large, frequently touched, and logically complex. `npx aidd churn` produces a ranked table using LoC × git churn × cyclomatic complexity, with gzip density as a supplemental column, so any team can run it in seconds before splitting a branch or opening a review.

## ✅ Fix Shell Injection in collectChurn

Replace `execSync` string interpolation with `spawnSync` args array to eliminate command injection risk.

---

## ✅ Add Missing Collector Tests

## Filter Non-Source Files from Results 🟡 LOW

`package-lock.json`, `README.md`, and other non-source files dominate scores despite being useless signal.

**Requirements**:
- Given default options, should exclude JSON, markdown, and lockfiles from results
- Given a `--ext` option, should allow the user to override the included extensions

---

## Validate `--days` Input 🟡 LOW

`--days abc` silently returns the full git history. Should fail fast with a clear message.

**Requirements**:
- Given a non-numeric `--days` value, should print an error and exit 1
- Given a non-positive `--days` value, should print an error and exit 1

---

## Add churn signal to /review 🟡 LOW

Add a single line to `review.mdc` instructing the agent to run `npx aidd churn` early and surface high-scoring files in the diff.

**Requirements**:
- Given a code review is running, should run `npx aidd churn` and flag diff files that rank in the top results

---

## Deduplicate ScoredFile Typedef 🔵 NITPICK

`ScoredFile` is defined in both `churn-scorer.js` and `churn-formatter.js`.

**Requirements**:
- Given the typedef exists, should be defined once and referenced by both files

---

## Fix TypeScript Runtime Dependency ⚠️ HIGH

`typescript` is in `devDependencies` but `tsmetrics-core` calls `require("typescript")` at runtime. Published packages omit devDependencies, so `npx aidd churn` fails with `Cannot find module 'typescript'` for any user who does not have TypeScript in their own project.

**Requirements**:
- Given `typescript` is used at runtime by `tsmetrics-core`, should be listed in `dependencies` not `devDependencies`
- Given our code only uses `ts.ScriptTarget.Latest` (the literal `99`), should not import `typescript` directly — let `tsmetrics-core` own that dependency

---

## Fix Division by Zero on Empty Files ⚠️ HIGH

`gzipSync(buf).length / buf.length` produces `Infinity` when `buf.length === 0`, which renders as `Infinity%` in the output table.

**Requirements**:
- Given an empty file, should return a `gzipRatio` of `0` instead of `Infinity`

---

## Fix Input Validation for CLI Options ⚠️ HIGH

`--days abc`, `--top abc`, and `--min-loc abc` silently produce `NaN`, which passes through to git or the scorer and causes cryptic errors instead of a clear user-facing message.

**Requirements**:
- Given a non-numeric `--days` value, should print a clear error and exit 1
- Given a non-positive `--days` value, should print a clear error and exit 1
- Given a non-numeric `--top` value, should print a clear error and exit 1
- Given a non-positive `--top` value, should print a clear error and exit 1
- Given a non-numeric `--min-loc` value, should print a clear error and exit 1
- Given a negative `--min-loc` value, should print a clear error and exit 1

---

## Fix Exit Code on Churn Errors 🟠 MEDIUM

`handleChurnErrors` catches and resolves the error, so the trailing `.catch(() => process.exit(1))` never fires. The command exits 0 even when a git error occurs, breaking CI pipelines.

**Requirements**:
- Given a git error, should print the error message and exit with code 1
- Given the command is run outside a git repository, should print an error and exit with code 1

---

## Fix File Column Alignment 🟡 LOW

The formatter uses `padStart` for all columns, giving file paths leading whitespace. Numeric columns should be right-aligned; the file path column should be left-aligned.

**Requirements**:
- Given output with files of varying path lengths, should left-align the file column and right-align all numeric columns

---

## Fix ALL_CAPS Constants 🟡 LOW

`JS_TS_EXTENSIONS` and `HEADERS` violate the project JavaScript guide ("avoid ALL_CAPS for constants").

**Requirements**:
- Given module-level constants, should use camelCase (`jsTsExtensions`, `headers`) per the JS style guide
