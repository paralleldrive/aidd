# Vision

## Recipes for App Discovery Framework

1. Vibe code prototype
2. Use AIDD with TDD to modularize, add tests
3. Add og/Twitter card tags and basic SEO headers (probably not gonna be searchable yet)
4. Get it in front of some people, get feedback, iterate
5. Add self documenting hypermedia APIs for AI/agent browsing. Connect the front end to these to source CMS content.
6. Add full SSR for front-end content, site maps, agents discovery files to tell AI about your hypermedia APIs.
7. Blog and RSS feeds for updates, changelogs, blog posts, and marketing channels.
