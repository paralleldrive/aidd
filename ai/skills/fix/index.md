### 🐛 aidd-fix

**File:** `SKILL.md`

Fix a bug or implement review feedback following the AIDD fix process. Gains context, validates whether a fix is needed, documents the requirement in the task epic using "Given X, should Y" format, implements via TDD (write failing test first, watch it fail, implement, watch it pass), runs e2e tests, self-reviews, then commits and pushes to the PR branch.
