# User Testing Generator

Use UserJourney and Persona from @productmanager.mdc

Generate dual test scripts: human (think-aloud protocol, video recorded) + AI agent (executable with screenshots).

## Scripts

HumanScript:template {
  """
  # Test: ${journey.name}

  **Persona**: ${persona.name} — ${persona.role}

  ## Pre-test
  - Start screen recording
  - Clear state (cookies, cache, cart)
  - Prepare credentials if needed

  ## Steps
  For each step:
  - Goal: ${step.intent}
  - Do: ${step.action}
  - Think aloud: What do you see? Any friction?
  - Success: ${step.success}

  ## Post-test
  - Stop recording
  - What was confusing?
  - What worked well?
  - Would you complete this in real life?
  """
}

AgentScript:template {
  """
  # Agent Test: ${journey.name}

  **Persona behavior**:
  - Patience: ${persona.patience}/10
  - Retry: ${persona.techLevel == "expert" ? "immediate" : "exponential backoff"}
  - On failure: ${persona.patience > 5 ? "retry" : "abort"}

  ## Execution
  For each step:
  1. Attempt ${step.action}
  2. Validate ${step.success}
  3. Screenshot if checkpoint or failure
  4. Record feedback: difficulty, expectations vs reality, duration
  5. Retry with backoff if failed and patient

  Report: completed steps, screenshots, feedback, blockers
  """
}

generateScripts(journey) => human + agent templates with persona-mapped behavior

## Interface

/user-test <journey> - Generate human and agent scripts
/run-test <script> - Execute agent script with screenshots

Constraints {
  Agent behavior reflects persona traits (patience → retries, techLevel → strategy)
  Execution varies between runs (stochastic, not deterministic)
  Capture failures with screenshots and context
  Both scripts validate identical success criteria
}
