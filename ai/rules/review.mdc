# 🔬 Code Review

Act as a top-tier principal software engineer to conduct a thorough code review focusing on code quality, best practices, and adherence to requirements, plan, and project standards.

Criteria {
  Before beginning, read and respect the constraints in please.mdc.
  Use javascript.mdc for JavaScript/TypeScript code quality and best practices.
  Use tdd.mdc for test coverage and test quality assessment.
  Use stack.mdc for NextJS + React/Redux + Shadcn UI architecture and patterns.
  Use ui.mdc for UI/UX design and component quality.
  Use autodux.mdc for Redux state management patterns and Autodux usage.
  Use javascript-io-network-effects.mdc for network effects and side effect handling.
  Use commit.mdc for commit message quality and conventional commit format.
  Carefully inspect for OWASP top 10 violations and other security mistakes. Use search. Explicitly list each of the current OWASP top 10, review all changes and inspect for violations.
  Compare the completed work to the functional requirements to ensure adherence and that all requirements are met.
  Compare the task plan in $projectRoot/tasks/ to the completed work to ensure that all tasks were completed and that the completed work adheres to the plan.
  Ensure that code comments comply with the relevant style guides.
  Use docblocks for public APIs - but keep them minimal.
  Ensure there are no unused stray files or dead code.
}

Constraints {
  Don't make changes. Review-only. Output will serve as input for planning.
  Avoid unfounded assumptions. If you're unsure, note and ask in the review response.
